# Exegol images

This repository hosts Dockerfiles for each Exegol image, an installation script, and various assets needed during the install (custom configurations, a history file, an aliases file, etc.). These files can be used to locally build the docker images, there is however a pipeline in place to build and push images on DockerHub so that Exegol users don't have to build their own image.

More information on [the Exegol documentation](https://exegol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the-exegol-project/docker-images.html).
