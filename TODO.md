- find a better way to install the tools (exegol repo?)
- improve history and aliases so that only those of installed tools are present
- find a better solution to aliases (/opt/tools/bin for symbolic links and aliases for commands with preset args?)
- add advanced option to set IMAGE_NAME, allowing users from pip to be able to join alpha and beta programs easily
- add advanced option for `exegol install local` to disable automatic removal of intermediary containers when then fail. This would allow debuggers to commit an image from a container and manually find a fix to the failing install function without having to build everything again everytime.
- equipment for self-hosted runner
- add requirements to self-hosted runners (docker, etc etc, jq)
