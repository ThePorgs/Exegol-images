"""
Unit Test Script to Run Multiple Commands Concurrently
======================================================

This script reads a list of commands from a file and executes them concurrently in separate subprocesses.
Each command is run in a Zsh shell with a set timeout.
The script logs the standard output and standard error of each command to separate log files based on the outcome of the command (success, failure, or timeout).

Run this script using an asyncio capable Python interpreter (Python 3.7+ recommended).
This script requires `asyncio` and `tempfile` libraries.
